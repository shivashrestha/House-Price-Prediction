## DSP Assignment, EPITA

This repository contains Python modules for predicting house prices. It's designed for a DSP assignment at EPITA by Shiva Shrestha.

**Modules:**

* **preprocess.py:** This module handles data preprocessing tasks like loading, cleaning, and transforming the dataset for use in training and inference.
* **train.py:** This module focuses on training a machine learning model for house price prediction.
* **inference.py:** This module enables using the trained model and making price predictions for new houses.

**Using the Modules:**

This project utilizes a custom build package named `house-prices-package-by-shiva`. To install it:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ house-prices-package-by-shiva
